# CycleGAN for Image-to-Image Translation

CycleGAN is a popular deep learning model used for unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. Implemented using PyTorch, it facilitates the conversion of images from one domain to another without the need for paired examples. In this specific instance, a pre-trained CycleGAN model has been employed to transform images of horses into those resembling zebras. This pre-trained model was obtained and is readily available for use.

## Human to Cat/Dog Image Translation

The PyTorch implementation of CycleGAN has been further utilized to translate images from the human domain to either cat or dog domains. For training purposes, a dataset comprising 3000 human images and an equal number of cat and dog images (1500 each) was employed.

## Training Process and Hyperparameters

In the training process, hyperparameters play a crucial role in determining model performance and convergence. Among these, the parameter `epochs=20` specifies the total number of training iterations, while `n_epochs_decay=5` represents the number of epochs after which the learning rate starts decaying. Decay is essential to prevent overfitting and stabilize training by gradually reducing the learning rate as training progresses.

## Model Deployment and Reusability

Upon completion of training, the PyTorch implementation saves the trained CycleGAN model in a designated folder, allowing for easy reuse and deployment in future image translation tasks. This enables efficient experimentation with different datasets and domains, offering flexibility and scalability in image transformation applications.

This project showcases the versatility and effectiveness of CycleGAN in image-to-image translation tasks, providing a robust framework for transforming images across diverse domains without the need for paired examples.
